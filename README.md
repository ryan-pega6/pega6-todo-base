# pega6-todo-base

This is a starter project that runs a very basic Vue 3 application.  You can modify it to turn it into an application for managing a Todo List.

## Building a todo app with this repo:

1. Ensure the Github Copilot Extension is installed
2. Open "Edit with Copilot" (Shift + Command + I)
3. Choose Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the model
4. Use Prompt: `Turn this vue app into a simple todo application`
5. Now you're on your own!  Have fun and remember to use Copilot!  

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How was this repo built?
From a blank repo, we ran `npm create vue@latest` and then we created this README file.  That's pretty much it.
